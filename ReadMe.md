I was born in Latvia and now live in the UK. I can speak English and Russian though not Latvian suprisngly haha. I've been programming ever since I was 12, first made a website by copying a html tutorial and now coding plugins in Minecraft or coding Discord bots. I am now 16 and have decided to make programming my career, even carrying on the computer science course in college.

## ðŸ’» Programmer
I've been programming a lot in Java and am very familar with it. I have enjoyed learning about the program and its use cases as well as its history.
I've also been now learning Go as the language is interesting and is promosing as well as already has backing from larger cooporations like Google.
I've dipped my hands a bit into Rust but am still learning it, though its on hold due to my Go adventures.
I've done many projects using Javascript/Typescript like coding Discord bots, Discord bot lists, my own websites, or websites for others. I've used frameworks like React, Next.js and Astro.
