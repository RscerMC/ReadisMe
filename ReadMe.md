# Rscer (Aleks)
I was born in Latvia and now live in the UK. I can speak English and Russian though not Latvian suprisngly haha. I've been programming ever since I was 12, first made a website by copying a html tutorial and now coding plugins in Minecraft or coding Discord bots. I am now 16 and have decided to make programming my career, even carrying on the computer science course in college when I finish secondary school this summer (2024).

## 💻 Programmer
I've been programming alot in Java and am very familar with it. I have enjoyed learning about the program and its use cases as well as its history.
I've also been now learning C++ This is mainly due for me wanting to get into game development and most companies require C++ knowledge as well as I like the language it's self myself.
I've dipped my hands a bit into Rust but am still learning it, though its on hold due to my C++ adventures.
I've done many projects using Javascript/Typescript like coding Discord bots, Discord bot lists, my own websites, or websites for others. I've used frameworks like React, Next.js and Astro.
